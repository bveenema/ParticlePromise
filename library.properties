name=ParticlePromise
version=0.0.3
author=Ben Veenema
license=MIT
sentence=Creates Javascript-like promises for webhook/API callbacks on the Particle ecosystem.
paragraph=Write a statement like, promise.create(sendWebhookFunc, "responseTopic").then(successFunc) and let the library keep track of calling your functions on return or calling different functions if the server doesn't respond. Can also accept inline functions (lambdas) so all of your API calling code is in one place.
